# Project7

Last project we had extended the Python API to return a JSON payload that returned the values: key, value, command, result, and error. If successful, the boolean woudl declare it to be true and if not then false. Then we deployed our API. 

For Project 7, we were to build a command line interface that can test and run the deployed API when called. In addition we began testing to transition our code from being a manual step to potentially being automated.
