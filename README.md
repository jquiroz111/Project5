# GroupProject7: Building and testing API clients
-Building a command line interface that interacts with your API 

-Writing an automated testing suite so you can modify your API while still guaranteeing that other clients wonâ€™t break

(From the commands instructed in Group Project 5)
In this project, we will allow the user to:
1. Return the MD5 hash of a user input string
2. Return the factorial of a user input integer
3. Return an array of Fibonacci numbers that are less than and equal to the user input integer
4. Return a boolean value on whether the user input integer is prime or not
5. Return a boolean value on whether a value of an input was posted successfully on the class Slack or not
